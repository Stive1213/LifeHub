Project: "LifeHub" - The Ultimate Personal Life Manager
Concept: A one-stop web platform where anyone—students, professionals, parents, retirees—can manage their daily lives, from tasks to finances to social connections, in a clean, approachable interface.

Problem It Solves: People juggle too many apps (calendar, budgeting, notes, etc.) and lose track of their lives. LifeHub brings it all together, simplifying chaos into a single hub that’s easy to use.

Why It’s Portfolio-Worthy: It’s feature-rich, scalable, and shows off front-end flair, back-end complexity, and integration skills—perfect for impressing employers.
